## The Protocol
Shit is yet another experimental protocol building upon the most exciting innovations in programmable money and governance. Built by a team of DeFi natives, it seeks to create:

* an elastic supply to seek eventual price stability
* a governable treasury to further support stability
* fully on-chain governance to enable decentralized control and evolution from Day 1
* a fair distribution mechanism that incentivizes key community members to actively take the reins of governance
